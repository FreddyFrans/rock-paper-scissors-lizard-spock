# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard & Spock
 ## Preface
 I took on this challenge with no JavaScript knowledge what so ever. Before the visitor try this game I want to give the credit to pritishnagpal at www.geeksforgeeks.org who gave me some more insight into how the structure of Javascript works.
 So thank you very much pritishnagpal!
 ## The Game
 
 The Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock game has five option buttons: rock, paper, scissors, Lizard and Spock. When the player clicks on an option, a comment is displayed where you find out if the player or the computer won, or if it was a draw. You have five attempts before the game is over. You can then click on a "Again!" button that appears if you want to try to play one more time.

## Features Left to Implement
* ### Favicon
  - I want to change to a more appropriate favicon that reflects the theme of the game.
* ### Images and Layout
  - Experiment with other color combinations and layouts in the game, such as, for example, images on the buttons instead of text and fireworks when the player won the game.
## Testing
  - The game is structured in such a way that you cannot imput emty or invalid data. all to give the user the maximum gaming experience.
  - I have had six people test the functions on the website where all of them uses different types of cellphones, all of them gave the site good feedback. No bugs were found when the people carried out the tests.
 - ### Errors 
   - I had a lot of problem with Codeanywhere, i had to go back to Gitpod 
   - I had a problem with the computer not choosing some selection buttons. This gave errors as you can see below. But after some help from my classmate Frank Arellano i got it sorted out by changing out several typos. Big thanks to Frank Arellano!
