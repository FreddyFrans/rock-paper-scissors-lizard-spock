# Rock, Paper & Scissors
 ## Foreword
 I took on this challenge with no JavaScript knowledge whatsoever. Before the visitor try this game I want to give the credit to pritishnagpal at www.geeksforgeeks.org who gave me some more insight into how the structure of Javascript works.
 So thank you very much pritishnagpal!
 ## The Game
 
 The Rock, Paper and Scissors game has three option buttons: rock, paper or scissors. When the player clicks on an option, a comment is displayed where you find out if the player or the computer won, or if it was a draw. You have five attempts before the game is over. You can then click on a button that appears if you want to try to play again.
